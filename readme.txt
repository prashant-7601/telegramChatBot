This bot was programmed to mimic the One Piece character Monkey D. Luffy. 
Requests module was used to communicate with telegram api and fetch data regarding the bot.
The bot was then trained using chatterbot module.
The dataset for the bot was written by me and is still insufficient for a proper chat bot.
The bot works in both personal chats as well group chats.
You can directly add the bot in your group to get started.
Note that the python script should be running for the bot to be responsive.
